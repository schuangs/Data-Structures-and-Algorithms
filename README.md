# Data Structures and Algorithms In C++

Implementations of **data structures** and **algorithms** using **C++** by *Junkang Huang*.


### pTime
A simple tool using `std::chrono` to measure how long a program runs. And you can set multiple checkpoints conveniently in a program.

### myPrint
Print vector in various mode to given ostream object.

### mySwap
Swap two elements in a vector.

### myBubbleSort
Bubble sort implementation.


### Selection Problem

**Input:** 	N numbers (not sorted)

**Output:** 	the k-th largest number  of input 
Using `std::priority_queue`.

### myBraceChecker
A simple tools to check brace balance of a file. 
Using `std::stack`.

### myPostfixCalculator
Using `std::stack` to calculate a postfix expression which is inputed as a std::string.
### myCalculator
Using `std::stack` to translate a infix expression into corresponding postfix expression.
Then using `myPostfixCalculator()` to calculate the result.
